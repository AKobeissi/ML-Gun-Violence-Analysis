# ML-Gun-Violence-Analysis
Conducted an in depth research analysis on over 200k gun violence incidents in the USA. Using various statistical techniques and machine learning models such as PCA, KMeans Clustering, RandomForests, and Gradient Boosting Machines. In the end I provided clear evidence and data-driven decisions for policy makers and governments to take.
Note, the gun violence dataset is too large to be imported to github, to find it you can access it on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jameslko/gun-violence-data
